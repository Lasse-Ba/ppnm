Compute different integrals I=∫dx∫dy f(x,y):

f(x,y) = xy integrated over x∈[0,1] and y∈[x,x^2] results in 
I=(-0.04166±0.0022) (should be -1/24≈-0.04167)


f(x,y) = exp(y)*sin(x) integrated over x∈[0,1] and y∈[-sin(x),exp(x)] results in
I=(-3.38641±0.05759) (should be 3.39164)


f(x,y) = -y - x*x + y*y*Cos(x)*Cos(x) integrated over x∈[0.5,1] and y∈[Sqrt(x),5] results in
I=(3.81191±0.05173) (should be 3.80859)
