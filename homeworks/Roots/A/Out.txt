Test the root-finder routine by finding the roots of f(x)=x^2-4:
One root is at 2.00064102511711  (should be at 2) and the other at -2.00000275481554  (should be at -2)


Test the root-finder routine by finding the roots of f(x)=(x^2-4, y^2-1):
One root is at (2.00064102511711, 1.00454545461599)  (should be at (2, 1)) 


--------------------------------------
Find the extrema of the Rosenbrock's Valley function of f(x)=(1-x^2)^2+100(y-x^2)^2:
The extrema are at (-0.999987507787423, 0.999975015291124) and (1.00001250551865, 1.00002501064571)  (should be at (Â±1, 1))
